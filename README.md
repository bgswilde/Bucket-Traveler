# Bucket Traveler
>  link web page

## Description
---
The purpose of Destination Hub (aka Bucket Traveler) is to make it easier for users to find and save a bucket list of travel destinations.  When searching a location, users will be able to find different attractions and create their own “bucket list” of events.

It is often hard to remember and research all the different attractions. We are building this website  to make the process more efficient.
## User Story
---
As a USER I want to search for vacation locations and find local attractions to visit while I am there.

Acceptance Criteria:

- When I enter a location into a search bar and click on the search icon to submit,

- Then the application will return up to 10 cards with a name of an attraction, image and a more button to get more information  

- So that I can build my dream bucket list of attractions to visit.

- Given that I want to save my selections,

- When I hit the save button on an attraction,

- Then it will save a list at the bottom for me to refer back to.

- When I type in a new location, then the cards onthe screen will be replaced with new cards from the newly searched location.

## Future Enhancements
---
Future Enhancements:

- Add map to display where all the attractions are in relation to the city searched

- Add flight and hotel capability 

- Add log in capability so that the saved list can be shared across devices.

- Return more results in search and add a carousel to display them.
